## Disclaimer

This program is still in development, and i'm not a genius. I am not responsible for a bad use. If you discover a new bug, problem, ... or have an idea for a new feature, please report it.
A lot of features are not implemented yet, and are still in development, but for now this program is functional for a basic use.


## Parameters

 - `Path` : must contain the absolute path of where to store the captures.
 - `Name` : generic name of your captures. For now the file's name is in format "YY-MM-DD_Name_id.jpg".
 - `Period` : how much between each capture (in milliseconds).
 - `Save Changes` : saves the current parameters.
 - `Start Capture` : starts the capture session. You can't change the parameters while capturing.
 - `Pause Capture` : pauses the capture session. You can't change the parameters. Press `Start Capture` to resume the current capture session.
